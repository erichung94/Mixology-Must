# MixologyMust

MixologyMust is a website/app that helps individuals look for their perfect drink based off ingredients or the name of a cocktail.

The user can either type in a drink name or the ingredients to make a drink and the application will return, based off the
user's criteria, the drink's name, an image of the drink, ingredients required, and instructions on how to make the drink.
